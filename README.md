# Retail-Sales-Analysis
This repository is about my Retail Sales Analysis project .For this project, I used Microsoft Excel to analyze over half a million transactions, cleaned the data, and built an interactive excel dashboard using Pivot Tables, slicers, charts and KPIs. The goal was to extract meaningful insights on sales trends, customers, and products.
